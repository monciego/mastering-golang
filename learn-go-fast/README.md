# Learn GO Fast

## Six main points about GO

1. Statically Typed Language
2. Strongly Typed Language
3. Go is Compiled
4. Fast Compile Time
5. Built in Concurrency
6. Simplicity

## Concepts of module and packages

A package is jus a folder that contains a collection of go files. Then a collection of these packages is known as a module. And when we're initializing our project we're initializing a new module.

## Constants, Variables, and Basic Data Types

### Declaring Variables of `int` Type

To declare a variable, we use the `var` keyword followed by the variable name and its type. Similar to imports, every declared variable should be used; otherwise, it will result in an error, preventing unused variables from cluttering the code.

```go
var intNum int
fmt.Println(intNum)
```

In addition to the `int` type, we have `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, and `int64`, which specify the amount of memory or bits used to store the number. For instance, 64-bit integers can store much larger numbers than 16-bit integers but consume more memory. Trying to initialize a variable with a number larger than the maximum value for its type will result in a compiler error, known as an overflow error. The compiler doesn't throw overflow errors at runtime, leading to unexpected results without any error message.

```go
var intNum int16 = 32767
intNum = intNum + 1
fmt.Println(intNum) // -32768
```

Additionally, there are unsigned integers (`uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`), which store only positive integers.

### Floating-Point Types: `float32` and `float64`

- `float32`: 32-bit decimal number
- `float64`: 64-bit decimal number, capable of storing larger and more precise decimal numbers but requiring more memory.

It's advisable to consider data types carefully rather than defaulting to `float64` or `int64`.

### Arithmetic Operations: Two Key Points

1. Arithmetic operations cannot be performed with mixed types, but one number can be cast to match the other type.
2. Integer division truncates the result toward zero, resulting in a rounded-down value.

### Strings

- Strings can be initialized using double quotes or backticks.
- Concatenation of strings is achieved by using the `+` operator.

```go
var greeting string = "Hello" + " " + "World"
```

- The length of a string can be obtained using the built-in `len` function, but note that it returns the number of bytes, not characters. Go uses UTF-8 encoding.
- To obtain the length of characters in a string, import the `unicode/utf8` package and use the `RuneCountInString` function.

```go
fmt.Println(utf8.RuneCountInString("y")) // 1
```

### Default Types

The default values for types are as follows:

- For integers and floats: `0`
- For strings: `""` (empty string)
- For booleans: `false`

Specifying types explicitly, especially when it's not obvious, is a good practice that enhances code readability.

### Constants

Constants are similar to variables, but their values cannot be changed after initialization. They must be explicitly initialized; there's no option for declaring a constant without an initial value.
